        "On October 21, Sanae Takaichi was elected Prime Minister of Japan. Takaichi, a member of Japan’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party, was former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s political protege and adopted his hardline views on immigration policy, the economy, and national security. Takaichi’s election was hailed by many, especially in the West, as a historic moment for female representation in Japan’s male-dominated politics ([Reuters, 2025](https://https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-takaichi-appoint-senior-lawmaker-katayama-finance-minister-fnn-says-2025-10-21/)). On November 7, Takaichi responded to questions about Japan’s reaction to a Taiwan contingency by saying that an invasion of Taiwan would be a “survival threatening situation” for Japan ([CSIS, 2025](https://www.csis.org/analysis/escalating-japan-china-tensions-insights-past-and-prospects-future)). Her comments drew swift blowback from China, which interpreted the response as a suggestion that the Japan Self-Defense Force would engage in a war over Taiwan. In the following weeks, Takaichi doubled down on her comments, as China instituted a series of economic sanctions on Japan ([NPR, 2025](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/05/g-s1-100860/china-japan-feud-over-taiwan)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Takaichi’s comments drew widespread criticism and support from those in support of her position, in opposition, and those who felt it was too early in her tenure to take a controversial stance on such a deeply contested issue. This research paper thus will seek to answer the following question: How did Takaichi’s remarks on Taiwan affect public sentiment around her presidency?\n"

        "To answer my research question, I will collect YouTube videos from the beginning of October to her election on October 21. Due to Takaichi’s lesser-known status prior to the election, particularly to Western audiences, I predict that sentiment analysis from October will be neutral, if not positive, as Takaichi’s election was the first time that a woman had occupied Japan’s top political office. Then, I will collect videos from her remarks from November 1st and onward, which I predict will demonstrate more negative sentiment as Takaichi’s remarks on November 7 drew widespread criticism as having needlessly provoked China [Times Magazine, 2025](https://time.com/7337322/japan-china-takaichi-spat-taiwan/).\n",

Title sentiment dropped sharply on October 20th, perhaps due to fallout from the break between the LDP and its long-time coalition partner, the Komeito, on October 10th. The loss of the partnership may have caused compound score sentiment to fall due to words like “fractured political landscape”, but title sentiment stayed neutral and positive throughout the issue, indicating that the headlines felt positively about Takaichi’s leadership.

Here, it is interesting to note that the YouTube channels with the most popular titles have changed drastically from Western news to lesser known channels such as New China TV or All Topic India. Perhaps prominent channels from before November 7th such as CBS or Nippon wrote more neutral articles that were overshadowed by the decidedly negative sentiment of the more popular videos.\n"

However, given that the topic drew strong criticism from both news agencies and viewers regardless of their perspective on the issue, sentiment is unlikely to improve until the issue comes to a resolution. Although the negative sentiment might not have been in direct criticism of Takaichi’s remarks, the resulting video titles revealed that her remarks ignited strong, negative reactions from public and official channels."
